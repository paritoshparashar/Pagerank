# Page Rank Project

This project is an implementation of a PageRank algorithm using C, designed to analyze directed graphs and compute the PageRank of its vertices. This project is part of the Saarland University Programming 2 course for the Summer Term 2024.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to compute the PageRank of vertices in a directed graph, which can be considered as websites connected by hyperlinks. The implementation uses two methods to calculate the PageRank:

1. **Random Surfer Model:** Simulates the behavior of a random surfer navigating through the network of websites to approximate PageRank.
2. **Markov Chain Model:** Uses mathematical foundations to compute PageRank with higher precision.

## Installation

To compile and run the program, ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`). Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pagerank.git
   cd pagerank
2. Compile the project using `make`
   ```bash
   make
