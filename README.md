# Pagerank

## Overview
In this project, you will implement a C program that can analyze directed graphs and compute the page rank of its vertices. The directed graphs that we are interested in can be considered as consisting of websites and the hyperlinks connecting two websites.
Section 2 introduces the random surfer model as well as the Markov chain model which will both be used to determine the page rank. The functionalities your program needs to implement is documented in section 3. Section 4 indicates which implemented functionalities will score what amount of points. The appendix gives more technical information, a theory background on graphs, and examples on how to manually work with Markov chains. Furthermore, it answers several frequently asked questions.
